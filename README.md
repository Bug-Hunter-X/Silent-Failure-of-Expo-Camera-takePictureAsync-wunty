# Silent Failure of Expo Camera takePictureAsync

This repository demonstrates a common, yet silent, error when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The issue arises when this method is called before the camera has fully initialized.  The problem is that no error is thrown; the function call simply fails without any obvious indication.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution that ensures `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera is ready. This involves using the `Camera.getStatusAsync` method to monitor the camera's status.
