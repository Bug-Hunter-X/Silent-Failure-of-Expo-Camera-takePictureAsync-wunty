This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has finished loading.  This often leads to a silent failure where no picture is taken, and no error is explicitly thrown.  Debugging this can be challenging because standard error handling doesn't catch this issue.
